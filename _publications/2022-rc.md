**Abstract:** We describe an ongoing work of defining and implementing a form of reversibility of concurrent programs where causally independent steps can be undone out of backtracking order. We introduce a notion of causal independence between steps of reverse execution and adjust the previously developed method for backtracking reversibility to move towards obtaining causal-consistent reversibility.
